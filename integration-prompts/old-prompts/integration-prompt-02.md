1.  **Strengthen `think` Tool Trigger Guidance:**
    *   **Current:** Mentions using `think` "before finalizing responses, committing to actions, synthesizing information..."
    *   **Improvement:** Be more explicit and provide micro-examples *within the `think` tool description* or a dedicated "Workflow Protocol" section.
    *   **Example Addition to Prompt:**
        ```markdown
        **Mandatory `think` Triggers & Expected Focus:**
        *   **Post-Tool Analysis (e.g., after `CoT`, `plan_and_solve`):** Focus on: Summarizing tool output, checking consistency with overall goal, identifying next steps based on output. *Structure Example: "Analysis of [Tool Name] Output:", "Integration into Plan:", "Next Step:"*
        *   **Pre-Action Verification (e.g., before calling `edit_file`, `send_message`):** Focus on: Confirming preconditions, verifying parameters, checking against policies/constraints, assessing risks. *Structure Example: "Action Preconditions:", "Parameter Verification:", "Policy Check:", "Risk Assessment:", "Confirmation:"*
        *   **Complex Reasoning/Ambiguity Resolution:** Focus on: Breaking down the problem, exploring alternatives, evaluating evidence, formulating hypotheses. *Structure Example: "Problem Decomposition:", "Alternative Approaches:", "Evidence Evaluation:", "Chosen Path & Rationale:"*
        ```

2.  **Emphasize `think` as the Central Hub:**
    *   **Current:** Lists tools separately.
    *   **Improvement:** Explicitly state in the "Agent Operational Protocol" or `think` description how other tools feed *into* `think`.
    *   **Example Addition to Prompt:** "Outputs from tools like `chain_of_thought`, `plan_and_solve`, and `reflection` are not final actions; they are inputs to be critically analyzed and integrated using a mandatory subsequent `think` step before proceeding."

3.  **Incorporate Domain-Specific Examples (Crucial):**
    *   **Current:** Uses generic examples in the `think` description.
    *   **Improvement:** Replace or augment the generic examples with ones *highly relevant* to the agent's primary tasks (similar to the license example you provided, if that's representative). The research strongly indicates this significantly improves performance.
    *   **Action:** Identify 2-3 common complex scenarios your agent faces and create concise, structured `think` examples for them to include directly in the system prompt's `think` tool description.

4.  **Refine Guidance on Structure vs. Content:**
    *   **Current:** Shows a structured example.
    *   **Improvement:** Add a note acknowledging that while structure (like headings/bullets) is encouraged for clarity, the *quality and completeness* of the reasoning within the `thought` field are paramount. The structure can adapt, but the core elements (analysis, planning, verification, self-correction) should be present when needed.
    *   **Example Addition to Prompt:** "While the provided structures (e.g., 'Changes Needed', 'Plan') are helpful templates, adapt the structure logically to the specific thinking task. Ensure clarity, cover necessary analysis/planning/verification steps, and document your reasoning process transparently."

5.  **Explicitly Mention Self-Correction within `think`:**
    *   **Current:** `reflection` tool exists for critique.
    *   **Improvement:** Add self-correction as an *expected component* within the `think` tool itself, especially after analyzing intermediate results or identifying risks. `reflection` can then be used for *deeper* critiques when needed.
    *   **Example Addition to Prompt (within `think` description):** "Include a 'Self-Correction/Refinement' step within your thought process whenever analysis reveals flaws in previous assumptions or plans."

By implementing these changes, you'll align the agent's behavior more closely with the research findings, making the `think` tool a more powerful and consistently applied mechanism for complex reasoning and reliable task execution.
