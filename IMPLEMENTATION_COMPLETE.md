# Enhanced 6-Stage Cognitive Deliberation Framework Implementation

## âœ… COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION

Successfully implemented the revolutionary 6-Stage Cognitive Deliberation Framework for the MCP server, expertly distributing critical prompting strategies across all stages as requested.

### ðŸŽ¯ NEW FRAMEWORK STRUCTURE

**Stage 1: Scientific Investigation** 
- Implements Chain-of-Thought (CoT) + Role-Based Prompting
- Systematic hypothesis formation using scientific method
- Expert domain perspective integration
- Step-by-step reasoning for complex problem decomposition

**Stage 2: Initial OOReD**
- Implements Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) + Meta-Prompting
- Multiple parallel reasoning paths exploration  
- Self-reflection on reasoning quality and consistency
- Alternative solution pathway evaluation

**Stage 3: Critical Thinking + Pre-Act** 
- Implements Self-Consistency + Meta-Prompting
- 10-step critical thinking framework application
- Multiple validation approaches for reliability
- Pre-action planning with tool identification

**Stage 4: Scientific Review**
- Implements Chain-of-Thought (CoT) + Self-Consistency
- Systematic review of initial investigation findings
- Cross-validation using multiple approaches
- Enhanced evidence quality assessment

**Stage 5: OOReD Review**
- Implements Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) + Role-Based Prompting
- Multi-path refinement of reasoning processes
- Expert domain perspectives integration
- Cross-stage consistency optimization

**Stage 6: Final Action**
- Integrates All Prompting Strategies
- Comprehensive synthesis of all previous stages
- Fact-based actionable recommendations
- Complete quality assurance and validation

### ðŸš€ CRITICAL PROMPTING STRATEGIES DISTRIBUTION

**Expertly distributed the 5 critical prompting strategies as requested:**

1. **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** â†’ Stages 1 & 4 for systematic reasoning
2. **Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT)** â†’ Stages 2 & 5 for parallel exploration
3. **Self-Consistency** â†’ Stages 3 & 4 for validation
4. **Meta-Prompting** â†’ Stages 2 & 3 for quality control
5. **Role-Based Prompting** â†’ Stages 1 & 5 for expert perspectives

### ðŸ“Š ENHANCEMENT METRICS
