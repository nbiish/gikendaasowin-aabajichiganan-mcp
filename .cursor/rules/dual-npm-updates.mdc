This codebases has two npm locations to publish to..
ABSOLUTELY MAKE SURE the versions for both of the following packages match before publishing:
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nbiish/gikendaasowin-aabajichiganan-mcp -> [package-gikendaasowin.json](mdc:package-gikendaasowin.json)
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nbiish/cognitive-tools-mcp -> [package-cognitive-tools.json](mdc:package-cognitive-tools.json)

Make sure to run [critical.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/critical.mdc) before publishing our changes and has the proper placeholders filled out for this codebase.

Update the [README.md](mdc:README.md) so that it references the latest (highest numbered) integration-promp-{num}.md.

Tools have a STRICT naming limit of 60 characters (we need to be alert for this in [index.ts](mdc:src/index.ts) before [index.js](mdc:build/index.js) builds):
EXAMPLE```markdown
gikendaasowin-aabajichiganan: assess_complexity_and_select_thought_mode - Combined server and tool name length (69) exceeds 60 characters
```

We use npx for our mcp server and need to publish to test our tooling.

Run [publish-both-packages.sh](mdc:scripts/publish-both-packages.sh).
